# Cat Galore

## Architectual decisions
Since there was limited time to build the assessment, I have not made many architectual decisions, that I would otherwise do in a larger project. I created a Dashboard.vue file to contain the code and styling for the dashboard. In a larger project I would work feature based and probably won't put the Dashboard.vue in a components folder.

I added a placeholder for the random image in case no image would be found.

Normally I would also add more error-handling and tests, but there was just not time enough in two hours to do so.

I also did not have time to properly make everything as responsive as I'd like to. It is responsive, but I would probably do it better if I would have the time. But of course in a real application that also depends on the client/designer's wishes.

Even though I have more expertise in Angular development I decided to challenge myself and build the assessment in Vue, to freshen up my Vue knowledge and because the real project will be coded in Vue as I understood.
